                    <span class="bold">1892</span> - John Ronald (“Ronald” to family and early friends) was born in Bloemfontein, South Africa, on 3 January 1892.
                    His father, Arthur Reuel Tolkien, went to South Africa in the 1890s for better prospects of promotion.
                    There he was joined by his bride, Mabel Suffield, whose family were not only English through and through, 
                    but West Midlands since time immemorial.

                    <span class="bold">1896</span> - February, his father died, and he, his mother and his younger brother Hilary returned to England.

                    <span class="bold">1900</span> - Your mother, Mabel and his sister May was received into tha Roman Catholic Church. From then on, both Ronald and Hilary were brought up in the faith of Pio Nono, and remained devout Catholics throughout their lives. The parish priest who visited the family regularly was the half-Spanish half-Welsh Father Francis Morgan.

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1904</span> - Mabel was diagnosed as having diabetes. She died on 14 November of this year, leaving two orphaned boys. At this point Father Francis took over, and made sure of the boys’ material as well as spiritual welfare, although in the short term they were boarded with an unsympathetic aunt-by-marriage, Beatrice Suffield, and then with a Mrs Faulkner.

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1911</span> - He was invited to join a party on a walking holiday in Switzerland, which may have inspired his descriptions of the Misty Mountains, and of Rivendell. In the autumn of that year he went up to Exeter College, Oxford where he stayed, immersing himself in the Classics English, the Germanic languages (especially Gothic), Welsh and Finnish, until 1913, when he swiftly though not without difficulty picked up the threads of his relationship with Edith.

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1913</span> - He took a job as tutor and escort to two Mexican boys in Dinard, France, a job which ended in tragedy. Though no fault of Ronald’s, it did nothing to counter his apparent predisposition against France and things French.

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1915</span> - Achieved a first-class degree, in June.At this time he was also working on various poetic attempts, and on his invented languages, especially one that he came to call Qenya [sic], which was heavily influenced by Finnish—but he still felt the lack of a connecting to his vivid but disparate imaginings together.

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1916</span> - In this years, he already hade a number of close friends at King Edward’s; 
                    in his later years at school they met regularly after hours as the “T. C. B. S.” 
                    (Tea Club, Barrovian Society, named after their meeting place at the Barrow Stores) 
                    and they continued to correspond closely and exchange and criticise each other’s literary work until 1916

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1916</span> - For many months Tolkien was kept in boring suspense in England, mainly in Staffordshire. Finally it appeared that he for France, and he and Edith married in Warwick on 22 March 1916. Tolkien and Edith married in Warwick on 22 March 1916. Eventually he was indeed sent to active duty on the Western Front, just in time for the Somme offensive. After four months in and out of the trenches, he succumbed to “trench fever”, a form of typhus-like infection common in the insanitary conditions, and in early November was sent back to England, where he spent the next month in hospital in Birmingham. By Christmas he had recovered sufficiently to stay with Edith at Great Haywood in Staffordshire. During these last few months, all but one of his close friends of the “T. C. B. S.” had been killed in action. Partly as an act of piety to their memory, but also stirred by reaction against his war experiences, he had already begun to put his stories into shape: <blockquote>“… in huts full of blasphemy and smut, or by candle light in bell-tents, even some down in dugouts under shell fire” [Letters 66].</blockquote> This ordering of his imagination developed into the Book of Lost Tales (not published in his lifetime), in which most of the major stories of the Silmarillion appear in their first form: tales of the Elves and the “Gnomes”, (i. e. Deep Elves, the later Noldor), with their languages Qenya and Goldogrin. Here are found the first recorded versions of the wars against Morgoth, the siege and fall of Gondolin and Nargothrond, and the tales of Túrin and of Beren and Lúthien.

                <li class="list-item">
                    <span class="bold">1917</span> - Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, although periods of remission enabled him to do home service at various camps sufficiently well to be promoted to lieutenant. It was when he was stationed in the Hull area that he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and there in a grove thick with hemlock Edith danced for him. This was the inspiration for the tale of Beren and Lúthien, a recurrent theme in his “Legendarium”. He came to think of Edith as “Lúthien” and himself as “Beren”.
